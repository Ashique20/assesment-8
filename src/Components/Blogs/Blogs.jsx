        Building a Comprehensive Book Tracking Website with React and Recharts
      </h1>
      <p className="text-xl mt-8">
        In the digital age, managing and tracking reading progress can become a
        daunting task for avid readers. To address this, we can build a book
        tracking website that not only keeps tabs on what you've read and what
        you wish to read but also visualizes your reading progress. In this
        article, we'll explore how to create such a website using React, the
        Context API, and Recharts.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-10">Introduction</h1>
      <p className="text-xl mt-8">
        Our book tracking website will provide users with three main features:
      </p>
      <ol className="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl font-bold">
        <li className="mb-2">
          Reading List Management: Users can add and manage books in their
          reading list.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Wish List Management: Users can maintain a list of books they wish to
          read.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Visualization: A bar chart will visually represent the user's
          reading progress.
        </li>
       
      </ol>
      
      <h1 className="text-3xl mb-8">Setting Up State Management with Context API</h1>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">
          Managing the state of a reading list and a wish list can become
          complex if handled locally in each component. React's Context API
          allows us to create a global state that can be shared across the
          entire application. By setting up a context, we can easily manage and
          access the lists of read and wished-for books.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">
          This context will include functions to add books to the reading or
          wish list and to handle potential errors, such as trying to add a book
          that's already in the list. Additionally, we will implement sorting
          functions to organize the reading list by different criteria, such as
          rating, total pages, or the year of publishing.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-3xl mt-8 mb-4">Creating Data Visualizations with Recharts</h1>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">
          To provide users with an engaging visual representation of their
          reading progress, we'll use Recharts to create a bar chart. Recharts
          is a composable charting library built on React components, making it
          easy to integrate with our existing React application.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-4">
          The bar chart will display books from the reading list, showing the
          number of pages read for each book. Customization options such as
          colors and shapes can be utilized to enhance the visual appeal and
          make the chart more informative.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-3xl mb-8">Integrating Components in the Main Application</h1>
        <p className="text-xl">
          With the context and visualization components ready, the next step is
          to integrate them into the main application. This involves wrapping
          the main component with the context provider, ensuring all child
          components can access the global state. The chart component will be
          placed in the main layout to provide users with a real-time visual
          update of their reading progress.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-3xl mb-8 mt-8">Conclusion</h1>
        <p className="text-xl">
          Creating a book tracking website with React, Context API, and Recharts
          provides a powerful tool for avid readers to manage and visualize
          their reading habits. By leveraging the Context API for state
          management and Recharts for data visualization, we can create an
          intuitive and interactive user experience.
